### What your developers have to know:

# Just Execute `coala`

### Right where your `.coafile` lies.

And of course, coala works on **Linux**, **Windows** and **Mac**! Just make sure
to use **Python 3**.

If you want to use coala for automatically review pull requests, consider using
[GitMate](http://gitmate.com/). Please mind that GitMate is a prototype.
