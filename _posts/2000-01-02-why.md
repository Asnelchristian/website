### Every static code analysis has a new user interface and other duplicated parts.

# coala unifies code analysis.

### coala provides a user and a developer interface, letting developers focus on logic only and users focus on content.

### coala is fully language independent and any analysis routine can be used for as many languages as it is fit for.
