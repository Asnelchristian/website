# Get It!

### `sudo pip3 install coala --pre`

Because of the huge advances the project does every day, we recommend installing
the current prerelease by using the `--pre` flag like indicated above . We go to
great lengths to ensure our master branch is stable at every time on all
platforms. If you still hit problems, try the tutorial without the `--pre` flag
and drop us a bug report!

-------------------------

# Try It!

### `cd project && coala --files=\*\*/\*.py --bears=PEP8Bear --save`

### Your configuration will be automatically saved to the `.coafile` in the current directory. Use `coala -A` to see what bears are available.

-------------------------

# Commit It!

### `git add .coafile && git commit -m "Add coala configuration"`
